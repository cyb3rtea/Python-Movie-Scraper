# Python Movie Scraper
## Descritption
This is a simple straight-forward python web scraper using BeautifulSoup4 in order to pull down a list of trending movies from showboxmovies.net

## Requirements
python 3.9
Python modules:
```
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 isntall requests
pip3 install time
```

## RUN
Once the requirements are met, simply run the file with
```
python3 movie_scraper.py
```
## Why?
Other than wanting to get a bit of practice in for an upcoming project, there is no real reason.
And yes, I am aware that pirating movies is bad, that's why there is no downloading of any content bar the webpage HTML itself.

## licensing
Anyone with youtube can write this code, have at it. But, I am in no way responsible for anything you decide to do with this code.
