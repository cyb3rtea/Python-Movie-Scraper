## Why?

Other than wanting to get a bit of practice in for an upcoming project, there is no real reason.
And yes, I am aware that pirating movies is bad, that's why there is no downloading of any content bar the webpage HTML itself.

Anyone with youtube can write this code, have at it. But, I am in no way responsible for anything you decide to do with this code.
